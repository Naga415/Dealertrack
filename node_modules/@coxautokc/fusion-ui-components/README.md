# Fusion UI Components 
 
A React component library for Cox Automotive. 
* Implements the [Tracksuit](http://www.get-tracksuit.com) design via [Fusion-Theme](https://ghe.coxautoinc.com/CoxAuto-UI/fusion/tree/master/packages/fusion-theme) 
* Built into [Fusion-Starter](https://ghe.coxautoinc.com/CoxAuto-UI/fusion/tree/master/packages/fusion-starter) 
* [Working examples of all components](https://fusion-ui.firebaseapp.com) 
* Many components use [React-Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/components.html) behind the scenes.
 
## Install
This is built into [Fusion-Starter](https://ghe.coxautoinc.com/CoxAuto-UI/fusion/tree/master/packages/fusion-starter). To use separately: 
 1. Register on [npmjs.com](https://www.npmjs.com) and [email the UI Team](mailto:UITeam@vinsolutions.com) your npm username to request access to [@coxautokc](https://www.npmjs.com/org/coxautokc) private packages. 
 2. `npm install --save-dev @coxautokc/fusion-ui-components` 
 3. Configure your app to compile Sass 
 4. See Demos below for working examples 
 
## Demos 
[See the docs for working examples of all components](https://fusion-ui.firebaseapp.com). 
 
## Other Tips 
### Avoid Named Imports 
Don't use this named import style. It will import the entire library into your project, which will slow page loads: 
```js 
import {StepIndicator} from '@coxautokc/fusion-ui-components'; 
``` 
 
Instead, import the exact component that you need as shown above. 
 
### Importing without styles 
Components can be imported without their stylesheet by importing the component directly from the components' folder: 
```js 
import StepIndicator from '@coxautokc/fusion-ui-components/lib/StepIndicator/StepIndicator'; 
``` 
 
## Candidate Components 
The following components are currently deployed in existing projects and being considered for inclusion in Fusion UI: 
 
| **Component** | **Usage Locations**| 
|----------|------| 
| Notes and History | Customer Record, Enterprise customer (activities) |

## Contributing 
This is an [inner sourced](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inner_source) project, so anyone is free to contribute a pull request. Want to contribute? See [CONTRIBUTE.md](CONTRIBUTE.md).
 
## Atomic Design 
Atomic Design is a philosophy for reusable component design, popularized by Brad Frost in his book, "[Atomic Design](http://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com)". Atomic design uses terms from biology to describe components of increasing complexity: atom, molecule, and organism. This repository is composed of these three types of components. 
 
 1. An **Atom** is the simplest component. Examples: Textbox, Button. 
 
 2. A **molecule** is composed of one or more atoms. Examples: Search Input,  
 
 3. An **organism** is composed of one or more molecules. Examples: Header, Footer, ContactForm. 
 
In all cases, the component is merely a function that returns HTML. No authentication or API concerns are embedded. 
 
This image sums up our philosophy and expectations for reusable component design.
