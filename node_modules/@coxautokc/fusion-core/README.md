# Fusion-core
This repository is for the Fusion-core npm package which contains build scripts, test configuration, and encapsulates references to over 75 npm packages used by Fusion.

## Get Started
You don't need to reference this package directly. Check out [fusion-starter](https://ghe.coxautoinc.com/CoxAuto-UI/fusion/tree/master/packages/fusion-starter). Fusion-starter references the Fusion npm package, which bundles all Fusion packages together in a single npm package.

### Why does package.json reference the exact version?
This assures that the build won't break when some new version is released. Unfortunately, many package authors don't properly honor [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org), so instead, as new versions are released, we'll test them and then introduce them into Fusion. But yes, this means when you do `npm update` no updated dependencies will be pulled down.

## Versioning
This project uses [semantic versioning](http://semver.org).
