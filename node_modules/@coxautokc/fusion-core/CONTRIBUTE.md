# Contributing 
 
## Quick Start 
Clone this project, then: 
``` 
npm install 
``` 
Submit a pull request to the master branch to request merging your change. 
 
## Branch Organization 
All features should be worked out of a well named feature branch. Branch off the master branch. Submit a pull request to merge your work into the master branch when your work is ready for review. 
 
## npm Scripts
This project uses npm scripts for automation 
 
|Script|Description| 
|------|-----------| 
|test|Run tests|
 
## Semantic Versioning 
This project follows [semantic versioning](http://semver.org). We release patch versions for bugfixes, minor versions for new features, and major versions for any breaking changes.

## Publishing a Release
Releases should be [handled via Lerna instead of separately from each package](../../CONTRIBUTE.md).
 
## Proposing a Change 
If you intend to change the public API, or make any non-trivial changes to the implementation, we recommend filing an issue. This lets us reach an agreement on your proposal before you put significant effort into it. 

To honor the [rule of three](https://blog.codinghorror.com/rule-of-three/), any component being proposed should ideally been used in three places. The component should honor our take on [Atomic design](https://ghe.coxautoinc.com/CoxAuto-UI/fusion-ui-components#atomic-design).
 
## Style Guide 
ESLint will catch most styling issues that may exist in your code. You can check the status of your code styling by running npm start. 
 
However, there are still some styles that the linter cannot pick up. If you are unsure about something, looking at [Airbnb's Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript) will guide you in the right direction. 

## Update Fusion Core with Create React App
Fusion core is a fork of Facebook's [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). When they release new versions, we have to manually update our side, but be careful not to overwrite our modifications.

**Update process**:
1. Get latest version of Create React App: `npm install -g create-react-app`  
2. In a new directory run `create-react-app updateApp`. 
3. Compare `updateApp/node_modules/react-scripts` with the contents of `fusion-core/scripts`. Any changes should be merged over except for code commented with `/* ENABLED/DISABLED FOR FUSION */`
5. Compare `updateApp/node_modules/react-dev-utils` with the contents of `fusion-core/scripts/fusion-dev-utils`. Any changes should be merged over except for code commented with `/* ENABLED/DISABLED FOR FUSION */`. We've only modified WebpackDevServerUtils.js (to disable suggesting using a different port) and clearConsole.js (to make clearConsole work on Windows). Omit react-dev-utils package.json since it's irrelevant for us.
6. Run fusion-starter to ensure everything is still functioning.
